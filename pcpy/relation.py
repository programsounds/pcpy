relation.py     Yota Kobayashi

A module for pitch-class set relations.

This module includes functions that take two pcsets to operate on or compute
a relation measure between them. For the functions of unary set operations,
use the operation module.

For the functions defined here, the parameters s1 and s2 are iterable of
type, that is, set, tuple, list, or Pcset object--an instance of Pcset class
from the module pcset--but not str, because each pc is represented by an int.

List of functions:
